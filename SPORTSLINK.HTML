Sports and games facilities include</p>

<ul>
	<li>A football field</li>
	<li>3 basket ball courts</li>
	<li>A kho-kho field</li>
	<li>A volleyball court</li>
	<li>A table tennis room</li>
	<li>Indoor spaces for Yoga, Aerobics etc.</li>
</ul>

<p>Students enjoy playing major field games like basketball and football, as well as volleyball, kho-kho and table tennis.&nbsp; The games activities include regular physical fitness exercises as well as matches. &nbsp;The annual athletics meet provides a focus for the development of athletic prowess and talent. In addition to specialist teachers in Physical Education, we utilize the services of professional coaches for honing up the skills of children in specific games.</p>

<p>Though we do not take part in any organized competitive sports, plenty of challenge is provided through coaching camps and invitations to outside teams for matches in various games. We also send a few teams to other schools for playing friendly matches.</p></div></div></div></div></div></div></section></body></html>
